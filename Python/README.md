## Overview
This repo is a collection of various projects written in Python, featuring both guided and personal projects.<br/>
The guided projects were sourced from the ["100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?couponCode=LETSLEARNNOWPP), which had been a fantastic resource.

Also, due to how github displays static renders of Jupyter Notebook files, please use this link <https://nbviewer.org/github/JustDavidF/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/tree/main/>, or the specific versions found in each directory, to see the more complete version of each notebook.
